## 1) Why I selected this piece
I chose this cover letter because it demonstrates my ability to apply the principles of professional communication in a real-world context. The task required tailoring a message for a specific employer (IMP Aerospace & Defence), aligning tone, structure, and content with industry expectations. This piece reflects my understanding of audience analysis and the importance of clarity and conciseness in job application materials.

## 2) What this shows about my development as a communicator
This assignment illustrates my growth in adapting technical experience into persuasive, reader-focused language. I moved beyond listing skills to framing them as value propositions for the employer, which aligns with the **Axioms of Communication** (e.g., communication is purposeful and irreversible) and the **7 C’s** (clarity, conciseness, courtesy). It also shows my ability to integrate technical details—such as experience with ANSYS, STK, and MATLAB—without overwhelming the reader.

## 3) How this piece showcases my communication skills
- **Clarity and conciseness:** The letter avoids jargon and uses short, impactful sentences.
- **Organization:** It follows a logical flow—introduction, qualifications, and closing call-to-action.
- **Tone:** Maintains professionalism while expressing enthusiasm for the role.
- **Audience adaptation:** Highlights skills relevant to aerospace structural integrity and ASIP programs.

## 4) Was I pushed outside my comfort zone?
Yes. Writing persuasively for a professional audience was challenging because it required balancing technical accuracy with readability. I had to revise multiple times to ensure the tone was confident but not arrogant, and that the content aligned with the employer’s priorities.

## 5) Was this my best work? Why or why not?
This is among my best work in terms of professionalism and alignment with the **7 C’s**. However, I would improve it by adding a stronger closing paragraph that explicitly connects my skills to the company’s mission and by quantifying achievements where possible.
