## 1) Why I selected this piece
I chose this group presentation because it highlights my ability to collaborate effectively and communicate complex ideas visually and orally. The topic—**Redesigning AI Fact-Checking: From Evaluation to Information**—is highly relevant in today’s digital landscape, where misinformation and AI reliability are critical issues. This project required not only technical understanding but also the ability to present ideas clearly to a mixed audience.

## 2) What this shows about my development as a communicator
This piece demonstrates growth in **team-based communication** and **visual storytelling**. I learned to adapt my writing style for slides, focusing on concise bullet points and impactful visuals rather than dense text. It also reflects my ability to coordinate with peers using collaborative tools (Discord) and to integrate feedback into a unified presentation. These skills align with the **Axioms of Communication** (e.g., communication is a two-way process) and the **7 C’s**, particularly clarity and conciseness.

## 3) How this piece showcases my communication skills
- **Visual Design:** Used clean layouts and minimal text to maintain audience engagement.
- **Content Structuring:** Organized the main content into logical sections—problem statement, benefits, limitations, ethical implications, and future use.
- **Collaboration:** Contributed to the main content section and ensured consistency across slides.
- **Audience Awareness:** Balanced technical depth with accessibility for a general audience.

## 4) Was I pushed outside my comfort zone?
Yes. Presenting as part of a group required negotiating different communication styles and ensuring consistency in tone and design. Additionally, simplifying technical concepts for a non-specialist audience was challenging but improved my ability to prioritize key messages.

## 5) Professional Assessment
This demonstrates strong collaborative communication and visual design capabilities. Future improvements could include enhanced data visualization and refined presentation delivery coordination for seamless team communication.
