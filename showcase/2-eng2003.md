## 1) Why I selected this piece
I selected this technical report because it represents my most comprehensive written work in ENG2003, combining technical depth with structured communication. The report addresses a complex, futuristic engineering challenge—deploying self-replicating robotic swarms for scalable space infrastructure—and required synthesizing research, organizing content logically, and presenting it for a general engineering audience.

## 2) What this shows about my development as a communicator
This piece demonstrates my ability to balance **technical rigor** with **readability**. I applied the **7 C’s** by ensuring clarity in definitions, conciseness in explanations, and completeness in coverage of technical, ethical, and governance aspects. It also reflects my understanding of the **Axioms of Communication**, particularly that communication is purposeful and contextual—I tailored the tone and structure for an audience unfamiliar with advanced astroengineering concepts.

## 3) How this piece showcases my communication skills
- **Executive Summary:** Condenses a 30+ page report into a one-page overview, highlighting key findings and recommendations.
- **Visual Integration:** Figures (e.g., Dyson swarm deployment model, TRL charts) and tables (e.g., risk matrix, ethical mitigation strategies) enhance comprehension.
- **Logical Flow:** Organized into sections—Introduction, Main Topics, Discussion, Risk Analysis, Ethical Considerations, and Future Research—making it easy to navigate.
- **Ethical Framing:** Goes beyond technical feasibility to address governance and sustainability, demonstrating audience awareness and responsibility.

## 4) Was I pushed outside my comfort zone?
Yes. This was the first time I wrote a technical report of this scale and complexity. It required extensive research, critical thinking, and integration of multiple perspectives (technical, strategic, ethical). Managing citations and ensuring coherence across sections was challenging but rewarding.

---

## 5) Was this my best work? Why or why not?
This is one of my strongest pieces because it combines technical accuracy with professional presentation. However, I would improve it by adding more visual summaries (e.g., infographics) and reducing redundancy in some sections to enhance conciseness.
