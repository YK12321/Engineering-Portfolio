## 1) Why I selected this piece
I selected this project because it demonstrates my ability to communicate complex technical and business concepts in a structured, professional format. The project involved developing a comprehensive proposal for a **real-time aerial mapping service** using drone technology, integrating technical design, financial analysis, risk management, and stakeholder engagement. It required clear articulation of objectives, scope, and deliverables for a multidisciplinary audience.

## 2) What this shows about my development as a communicator
This piece highlights my growth in **technical writing and project documentation** beyond ENG2003. It shows that I can apply the **7 C’s**—particularly clarity, completeness, and coherence—while addressing diverse stakeholder needs. It also reflects my ability to synthesize large volumes of information into an accessible format, aligning with the **Axioms of Communication** (e.g., communication is contextual and purposeful).

## 3) How this piece showcases my communication skills
- **Executive Summary:** Condenses a multi-section report into a concise, high-level overview for decision-makers.
- **Visual Aids:** Includes cost tables, WBS diagrams, and milestone charts to enhance understanding.
- **Audience Adaptation:** Balances technical details (e.g., drone specs, energy calculations) with strategic and financial insights for non-technical stakeholders.
- **Professional Tone:** Maintains formal, business-oriented language throughout.

## 4) Was I pushed outside my comfort zone?
Yes. This project required integrating engineering concepts with business case development, which was new to me. I had to learn how to present financial metrics (NPV, IRR, payback period) and risk registers in a way that was both accurate and easy to interpret.

---

## 5) Professional Assessment
This represents strong interdisciplinary project communication, effectively integrating engineering analysis, project management, and business strategy. Future enhancements could include enhanced visual summaries and refined technical language for broader stakeholder accessibility.
