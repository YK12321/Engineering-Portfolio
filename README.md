# ENG2003 Communication Portfolio — GitHub Pages Template

This repository is a ready-to-publish GitHub Pages site that satisfies the structure and marking rubric for **ENG 2003 Term Project 02 – Communication Portfolio** (due Aug 15, 2025). It includes:

- A home page with a clear summary and prominent LinkedIn link
- Four showcase pages (3 from ENG2003 + 1 from another communications-related activity in 2024–2025)
- A reflection section (500–1,000 words total; split into Part A + Part B)
- A uniquely tailored (passion project) section
- A built-in checklist aligned to the rubric

> **Reminder**: Make sure your portfolio remains publicly accessible until **Sep 30, 2025** and submit the written portions of your **showcase descriptions** and **reflection** to Turnitin as required. See the checklist page for details.

## Quick Start

1. **Use this template**
   - Click **Use this template** → **Create a new repository** on GitHub, or download and upload to a new repo.
2. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - GitHub → **Settings** → **Pages** → *Build and deployment* → **Source: Deploy from a branch**
   - **Branch:** `main` — **Folder:** `/ (root)` → **Save**
3. **Edit site content**
   - Update `_config.yml` with your **name**, **title**, and **LinkedIn URL**.
   - Edit Markdown files in `index.md`, `showcase/*.md`, `reflection/index.md`, and `projects/index.md`.
4. **Add artefacts** (reports, slides, images, code links) to `assets/` and link them from the showcase pages.
5. **Publish**
   - Wait for the build (usually < 1 min). Your site will appear at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

## Turnitin submission
Export the **written portions** (the four showcase write-ups + reflection) to a single `.docx` or `.pdf` and submit to Turnitin. You can copy-paste from the Markdown pages or print to PDF from the browser. Follow the file naming convention `FirstName_LastName_ENG2003W23_TermProject2.pdf` (adjust term code if needed).
