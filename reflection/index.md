## Part A — Overall Course Reflection (≈ 300 words)

My experience in **ENG2003: Effective Engineering Communication** has been both challenging and transformative. At the start of the course, I expected a focus on grammar and report formatting, but the curriculum went far beyond that, emphasizing the **Axioms of Communication** and the **7 C’s** as foundational principles for professional engineering communication. This shift in perspective helped me understand that communication is not just about correctness—it is about clarity, purpose, and audience adaptation.

One of the most useful aspects of the course was learning how to craft **professional correspondence**, such as cover letters. The first assignment taught me to tailor my message to a specific employer, ensuring that every sentence served a purpose. This exercise reinforced the importance of **clarity, conciseness, and courtesy**, three of the 7 C’s that I now consciously apply in all professional writing.

Another highlight was the **technical report project**, which required synthesizing complex research into a structured, accessible document. This experience taught me how to balance technical depth with readability, using visuals and executive summaries to enhance comprehension. It also demonstrated the axiom that “communication is contextual”—the same technical content must be framed differently for different audiences.

Finally, the **group presentation on AI fact-checking** was one of the most engaging activities. It pushed me to think about **visual storytelling** and oral delivery, skills that are often overlooked in engineering education. Collaborating with peers also reinforced the axiom that “communication is a two-way process,” as success depended on active listening and feedback.

Overall, ENG2003 exceeded my expectations by equipping me with practical tools and frameworks that extend beyond the classroom. These skills will be invaluable in both academic and professional settings.

## Part B — Personal Growth & Development (≈ 350 words)

Before ENG2003, I considered myself a competent writer, but my approach lacked structure and strategic intent. I often focused on technical accuracy at the expense of clarity and audience engagement. Through this course, I have significantly improved in three key areas: **professional correspondence**, **technical documentation**, and **presentation skills**.

First, my ability to write **professional documents** has improved dramatically. The cover letter assignment taught me how to frame my technical experience as a value proposition for employers. I learned to apply the **7 C’s**—especially clarity, conciseness, and completeness—while maintaining a courteous tone. This skill will be critical when applying for internships and co-op positions.

Second, I developed stronger **technical writing skills** through the term project report on self-replicating autonomous systems. This was the most challenging piece of writing I have ever done because it required integrating technical, ethical, and strategic considerations into a coherent narrative. I learned to use headings, figures, and tables effectively, and to write an executive summary that captures the essence of a 30-page report in one page. This experience reinforced the axiom that “communication is irreversible”—once a report is submitted, it becomes a permanent record of your professionalism.

Third, I improved my **oral and visual communication skills** through the group presentation on AI fact-checking. Simplifying complex ideas for a general audience and designing visually appealing slides taught me the importance of **channel richness** and **feedback loops** in communication. It also highlighted the value of collaboration and adaptability.

Despite these improvements, I recognize areas for growth. I need to work on **time management** during large projects to allow more time for editing and peer review. I also want to refine my ability to incorporate **data visualization** into reports and presentations for greater impact.

Moving forward, I will apply these lessons in other engineering courses by prioritizing clarity and audience awareness in lab reports, design documentation, and presentations. In professional practice, these skills will help me communicate effectively with multidisciplinary teams, clients, and stakeholders—ensuring that my technical expertise translates into actionable insights.
